# CSS Only Shimmer Button

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/simeydotme/pen/gOqNxRa](https://codepen.io/simeydotme/pen/gOqNxRa).

I was really inspired by an old button from Aaron which had a glowing edge, using an SVG effect. I wanted to see if I can create something similar with CSS only.  
  
I really love this.
